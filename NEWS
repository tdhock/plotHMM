2022.1.25

Use #include <RcppArmadillo.h> in src/*.cpp files instead of
<armadillo> to avoid g++ compilation warnings such as "violates the
C++ One Definition Rule [-Wodr]" on CRAN LTO Additional check.  Note
that most src/*.cpp files are still portable, you would just need to
change back to <armadillo> (no Rcpp data types used).

2022.1.18

Set ARMA_DONT_PRINT_ERRORS in src/*.cpp files to avoid win-builder
NOTE Found '_ZSt4cerr', possibly from 'std::cerr' (C++).

2021.10.26

Vignettes: compare_depmixS4, multiple_sequences.

2021.10.18

New functions multiply, pairwise, transition, viterbi.

Transition and initial probability parameter arguments are now in log
space, to avoid underflow.

Initial version with forward and backward algorithms.
