Changes in version 2023.8.28

- Convert NEWS.
- Use Suggests conditionally.

Changes in version 2022.1.25

- Use #include <RcppArmadillo.h> in src/*.cpp files instead of <armadillo> to avoid g++ compilation warnings such as "violates the C++ One Definition Rule [-Wodr]" on CRAN LTO Additional check.  Note that most src/*.cpp files are still portable, you would just need to change back to <armadillo> (no Rcpp data types used).

Changes in version 2022.1.18

- Set ARMA_DONT_PRINT_ERRORS in src/*.cpp files to avoid win-builder NOTE Found '_ZSt4cerr', possibly from 'std::cerr' (C++).

- Vignettes: compare_depmixS4, multiple_sequences.

Changes in version 2021.10.18
