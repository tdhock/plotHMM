plotHMM: Plot Hidden Markov Models

| [[file:tests/testthat][tests]] | [[https://github.com/tdhock/plotHMM/actions][https://github.com/tdhock/plotHMM/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg]] |

Algorithms for Hidden Markov Models involve recursion over data
points, which can be slow in R. This package provides C++
implementations of these algorithms, with a focus on returning
intermediate results that can be used to create plots/visualizations
that help understand these algorithms.

** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  if(!requireNamespace("remotes"))install.packages("remotes")
  remotes::install_github("tdhock/plotHMM")
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Algorithms provided are =plotHMM::FUN_interface= where =FUN= is one
of: =forward=, =backward=, =multiply=, =pairwise=, =transition=,
=viterbi=. See help and example pages for more info.

** Timings

R implementations of HMM inference algorithms can be found in
[[file:tests/testthat/test-CRAN-plotHMM.R]]. Using C++ code is about 100x
faster than R code for the forward algorithm.
